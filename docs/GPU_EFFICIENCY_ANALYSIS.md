## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Best Development GPU

```hcl
# In your terraform configuration
module "gpu_droplet" {
  source = "../../modules/gpu_droplet"
  
  name     = "dev-gpu"
  region   = "nyc2"
  gpu_size = "gpu-rtx4000x1-20gb"  # Based on development recommendations
  
  # ... other configuration
}

# Check recommendations
output "dev_recommendations" {
  value = module.gpu_droplet.gpu_efficiency_analysis.recommendations.development
}
```

### Example 2: Compare All Options

```bash
# View complete efficiency rankings
terraform output gpu_efficiency_rankings

# Example output:
# {
#   "performance_per_dollar" = {
#     "gpu-h100x1-80gb" = {
#       "description" = "443.3 TFLOPS per $/hour"
#       "metric" = 443.3
#       "rank" = 1
#     }
#     "gpu-mi300x1-192gb" = {
#       "description" = "408.4 TFLOPS per $/hour"
#       "metric" = 408.4
#       "rank" = 2
#     }
#   }
# }
```

### Example 3: Large Model Workload

```hcl
# For large language models requiring high memory
module "gpu_droplet" {
  source = "../../modules/gpu_droplet"
  
  name     = "llm-training"
  region   = "nyc2"
  gpu_size = "gpu-mi300x1-192gb"  # High memory, good value
  
  # Enable both LocalAI and Ollama for testing
  install_localai = true
  install_ollama  = true
}
```

## Cost Analysis Integration

The efficiency analysis integrates with the enhanced cost tracking:

```bash
# View comprehensive cost breakdown
terraform output cost_summary

# Example output:
# {
#   "daily_total" = "$76.80 per day"
#   "hourly_total" = "$3.2000 per hour"
#   "monthly_total" = "$2339.52 per month"
# }
```

## Regional Availability

GPU availability varies by region:
- **NYC2**: All GPU types available
- **TOR1**: All GPU types available  
- **ATL1**: All GPU types available
- **Other regions**: No GPU droplets currently available

## Best Practices

### 1. Development Workflow
- Start with **RTX 4000** for development and prototyping
- Scale up to **H100** or **MI300X** for production training
- Use efficiency analysis to optimize costs

### 2. Training Workloads
- Prioritize **performance per dollar** rankings
- Consider **MI300X** for memory-intensive models
- Use **H100x8** for distributed training

### 3. Inference Workloads
- Balance performance and memory requirements
- **H100x1** offers best performance for single-GPU inference
- **MI300X** provides more memory for larger models

### 4. Cost Optimization
- Monitor hourly costs for short-term experiments
- Use daily/monthly projections for budget planning
- Consider regional availability for cost differences

## Automation

You can automate GPU selection based on efficiency analysis:

```hcl
locals {
  # Automatically select best value GPU for training
  best_training_gpu = [
    for gpu in module.gpu_droplet.gpu_efficiency_analysis.recommendations.training.recommended_gpus :
    gpu.gpu_size
  ][0]
}

module "auto_gpu_droplet" {
  source = "../../modules/gpu_droplet"
  
  name     = "auto-selected-gpu"
  region   = "nyc2"
  gpu_size = local.best_training_gpu
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No GPUs Available
If no GPUs are available in your region:
1. Check supported regions (NYC2, TOR1, ATL1)
2. Verify DigitalOcean account has GPU access
3. Consider alternative regions

### Efficiency Analysis Empty
If efficiency analysis returns empty results:
1. Ensure you're using a GPU-supported region
2. Check that GPU specifications are up to date
3. Verify module version compatibility

## Updates and Maintenance

GPU specifications and pricing are updated regularly. The analysis includes:
- Current market pricing (updated quarterly)
- Performance benchmarks from official sources
- Real-world efficiency metrics
