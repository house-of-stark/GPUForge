## 💰 Cost Analysis - What Will This Cost Me?

### 💾 **Snapshot Storage Costs** (The Monthly Bill)
📊 **"How much will storing my backups cost?"**

- **Rate**: $0.05/GB/month
- **Typical GPU Droplet**: 20-50GB (base OS + software)
- **With Models/Data**: 100-500GB+
- **Monthly Cost**: $1-25+ depending on size

### Cost Examples
```
RTX 4000 (minimal setup):     ~25GB = $1.25/month
H100 (with models):          ~200GB = $10.00/month  
H100 (with large datasets):  ~500GB = $25.00/month
```

### 💰 **Cost Optimization Strategies** (Save Money on Backups)
💡 **"How can I minimize backup costs?"**

1. **Regular cleanup** of old snapshots
2. **Selective snapshots** - only for important milestones
3. **Compress data** before snapshotting
4. **Use external storage** for large datasets

## 🤖 Automation & Scheduling - Set It and Forget It

- Consider encryption for sensitive model data

## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Snapshots
```hcl
locals {
  is_production = var.environment == "production"
  is_expensive  = contains(["gpu-h100x8-640gb", "gpu-mi300x8-1536gb"], var.gpu_size)
}

module "gpu_droplet" {
  source = "../../modules/gpu_droplet"
  
  # ... other configuration
  
  # Only snapshot production or expensive droplets
  create_snapshot_on_destroy = local.is_production || local.is_expensive
  snapshot_name              = local.is_production ? "prod-${var.model_version}" : ""
}
```

### 🔗 **CI/CD Integration** (Automate Everything!)
⚙️ **"How do I integrate this with my deployment pipeline?"**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Cleanup GPU Droplet with Snapshot
  run: |
    # Authenticate doctl
    echo "${{ secrets.DO_API_TOKEN }}" | doctl auth init --access-token-stdin
    
    # Destroy with snapshot
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
    
    # Verify snapshot creation
    doctl compute snapshot list --format Name,Created | grep "$(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

This snapshot functionality ensures that your expensive GPU configurations and trained models are never lost during infrastructure changes, providing peace of mind and cost protection for AI/ML workloads.
