## 🛠️ Configuration Examples - Copy & Paste Ready!

### 🔑 **Super Simple Setup** (Most Popular!)
👤 **"I just want it to work!"**
```hcl
module "gpu_droplet" {
  source = "../../modules/gpu_droplet"
  
  # Automatic SSH key import (default behavior)
  auto_import_ssh_keys = true    # Import all keys from account
  ssh_key_names        = []      # Empty = import all keys
  ssh_private_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"  # Your private key path
}
```

### 🎯 **Security-Conscious Setup**
🛡️ **"I want to control exactly which keys have access"**
```hcl
module "gpu_droplet" {
  source = "../../modules/gpu_droplet"
  
  # Import only specific named keys
  auto_import_ssh_keys = true
  ssh_key_names        = ["my-laptop", "work-desktop", "backup-key"]
  ssh_private_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

### ⚙️ **Advanced/Legacy Setup**
🔧 **"I need full control or have existing automation"**
```hcl
module "gpu_droplet" {
  source = "../../modules/gpu_droplet"
  
  # Disable auto-import, use manual IDs
  auto_import_ssh_keys = false
  ssh_key_ids          = ["12345678", "87654321"]
  ssh_private_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

## 🔍 Behind the Scenes - The Technical Magic

### 🤖 **Data Sources (The Detective Work)**
Our module uses DigitalOcean's API to be your SSH key detective:

```hcl
# Get all SSH keys from account
data "digitalocean_ssh_keys" "account_keys" {
  count = var.auto_import_ssh_keys && length(var.ssh_key_ids) == 0 ? 1 : 0
}

# Get specific keys by name
data "digitalocean_ssh_key" "named_keys" {
  count = var.auto_import_ssh_keys && length(var.ssh_key_names) > 0 ? length(var.ssh_key_names) : 0
  name  = var.ssh_key_names[count.index]
}
```

### 🧠 **Smart Selection Logic** (How We Choose)
Here's the decision tree our module follows:
```hcl
# Priority order:
1. Manual ssh_key_ids (if provided)
2. Named keys from ssh_key_names (if provided)
3. All keys from account (default)
```

## ✅ Prerequisites - What You Need First

### 🔑 **1. SSH Keys in Your DigitalOcean Account**
📝 **"Do I have SSH keys uploaded to DigitalOcean?"**
```bash
# List your SSH keys
doctl compute ssh-key list

# Add a new SSH key
doctl compute ssh-key create my-new-key --public-key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### 💻 **2. Private Keys on Your Computer**
🏠 **"Do I have the matching private keys locally?"**
- Ensure you have the private keys for any public keys in your DO account
- Private keys should have proper permissions (600)
- Default location: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

### 🌐 **3. DigitalOcean API Token**
🔐 **"Can Terraform talk to DigitalOcean?"**
- Terraform provider must be authenticated with your DO account
- API token should have read access to SSH keys

## 🛡️ Security Considerations - Keep Your Droplets Safe!

### 🚨 **Important Security Reminders**
⚠️ **"What should I know about SSH key security?"**
- **All imported keys** get root access to the droplet
- **Review your DigitalOcean SSH keys** regularly
- **Remove unused keys** from your DO account

### 🏆 **Best Practices from Security Experts**
✨ **"How do the pros do it?"**
```hcl
# Production: Use specific named keys
ssh_key_names = ["production-admin", "monitoring-system"]

# Development: Can use all keys for convenience
ssh_key_names = []  # All keys

# Sensitive workloads: Use manual key IDs for maximum control
auto_import_ssh_keys = false
ssh_key_ids = ["trusted-key-id-only"]
```

### 🔒 **Private Key Security - Protect Your Keys!**
🛡️ **"How do I keep my private keys safe?"**
```bash
# Proper private key permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/production_rsa

# Secure key storage
# - Use SSH agent for key management
# - Consider hardware security keys for production
# - Rotate keys regularly
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting - When Things Go Wrong

### 😵 **"No SSH Keys Found" Error**
❌ **Problem**: `Error: No SSH keys configured for droplet`
```
Error: No SSH keys configured for droplet
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check if you have SSH keys in your DigitalOcean account:
   ```bash
   doctl compute ssh-key list
   ```

2. Add SSH keys to your account:
   ```bash
   doctl compute ssh-key create my-key --public-key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

3. Verify auto-import is enabled:
   ```hcl
   auto_import_ssh_keys = true
   ```

### 🚫 **"Connection Refused" Error**
❌ **Problem**: `ssh: connect to host X.X.X.X port 22: Connection refused`
```
ssh: connect to host X.X.X.X port 22: Connection refused
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check droplet is running:
   ```bash
   terraform output droplet_ip
   ```

2. Verify SSH key permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

3. Test with verbose output:
   ```bash
   ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@DROPLET_IP
   ```

### 🔍 **"SSH Key Name Not Found" Error**
❌ **Problem**: `Error: SSH key "my-key-name" not found`
```
Error: SSH key "my-key-name" not found
```

**Solutions:**
1. List available key names:
   ```bash
   doctl compute ssh-key list --format Name
   ```

2. Use exact key name from DigitalOcean:
   ```hcl
   ssh_key_names = ["exact-name-from-do-account"]
   ```

3. Or use auto-import all keys:
   ```hcl
   ssh_key_names = []  # Import all keys
   ```

### 🔐 **"Permission Denied" Error**
❌ **Problem**: `Permission denied (publickey)`
```
Permission denied (publickey)
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you have the private key for the public key in DO:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Should match public key in DO
   ```

2. Check SSH agent:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l  # List loaded keys
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Add key to agent
   ```

3. Use correct private key path:
   ```hcl
   ssh_private_key_path = "~/.ssh/correct_private_key"
   ```
